<p>My name is Margaret and I work in marketing. I've lived in the bay area about 4 years. I grew up in Huntington Beach, CA. I also spent some time in New Jersey for work. It's strange coming back to school after all these years, but so far it's ok!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I work in ecommerce and I want to learn more about mobile web development. I think this will be helpful to learn for work and also fun to understand and appreciate all the apps I use today.</p>
